# Test-Driven Development

## Overview

Use this skill for ticketed implementation when product code, tests, or workflow behavior changes. It complements
`.agents/skills/_shared/delivery-contract.md`: implementation must create committed
automated coverage for every acceptance criterion before product-code handoff, then use vertical RED/GREEN cycles.

## Shared Context

Before applying TDD inside this repository, follow `.agents/skills/_shared/skill-startup.md`, read
`docs/conventions/context-management.md`, and verify the active ticket, OpenSpec artifacts, acceptance
criteria, validation expectations, and handoff rules against current files or live provider output. Keep memory
subordinate to the current ticket and delivery contract.

## Philosophy

**Core principle**: Tests should verify behavior through public interfaces, not implementation details. Code can change
entirely; tests shouldn't.

**Good tests** are integration-style: they exercise real code paths through public APIs. They describe _what_ the system
does, not _how_ it does it. A good test reads like a specification - "user can
checkout with valid cart" tells you exactly what capability exists. These tests survive refactors because they don't
care about internal structure.

**Bad tests** are coupled to implementation. They mock internal collaborators, test private methods, or verify through
external means (like querying a database directly instead of using the
interface). The warning sign: your test breaks when you refactor, but behavior hasn't changed. If you rename an internal
function and tests fail, those tests were testing implementation, not behavior.

See [tests.md](tests.md) for examples and [mocking.md](mocking.md) for mocking guidelines.

## Anti-Pattern: Horizontal Slices

**DO NOT write all tests first, then all implementation.** This is "horizontal slicing" - treating RED as "write all
tests" and GREEN as "write all code."

This produces **crap tests**:

- Tests written in bulk test _imagined_ behavior, not _actual_ behavior
- You end up testing the _shape_ of things (data structures, function signatures) rather than user-facing behavior
- Tests become insensitive to real changes - they pass when behavior breaks, fail when behavior is fine
- You outrun your headlights, committing to test structure before understanding the implementation

**Correct approach**: Vertical slices via tracer bullets. One test -> one implementation -> repeat. Each test responds
to what you learned from the previous cycle. Because you just wrote the code, you
know exactly what behavior matters and how to verify it.

```text
WRONG (horizontal):
  RED:   test1, test2, test3, test4, test5
  GREEN: impl1, impl2, impl3, impl4, impl5

RIGHT (vertical):
  RED->GREEN: test1->impl1
  RED->GREEN: test2->impl2
  RED->GREEN: test3->impl3
  ...
```

## Workflow

### 1. Planning

When exploring the codebase, read `CONTEXT.md` (if it exists) so that test names and interface vocabulary match the
project's domain language, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Before writing any code:

- [ ] Confirm with user what interface changes are needed
- [ ] Confirm with user which behaviors to test (prioritize)
- [ ] Identify opportunities for deep modules (small interface, deep implementation) - run the `/codebase-design` skill
for the vocabulary and the testability checks
- [ ] List the behaviors to test (not implementation steps)
- [ ] Get user approval on the plan

Ask: "What should the public interface look like? Which behaviors are most important to test?"

**You can't test everything.** Confirm with the user exactly which behaviors matter most. Focus testing effort on
critical paths and complex logic, not every possible edge case.

### 2. Tracer Bullet

Write ONE test that confirms ONE thing about the system:

```text
RED:   Write test for first behavior -> test fails
GREEN: Write minimal code to pass -> test passes
```

This is your tracer bullet - proves the path works end-to-end.

### 3. Incremental Loop

For each remaining behavior:

```text
RED:   Write next test -> fails
GREEN: Minimal code to pass -> passes
```

Rules:

- One test at a time
- Only enough code to pass current test
- Don't anticipate future tests
- Keep tests focused on observable behavior

### 4. Refactor

After all tests pass, look for [refactor candidates](refactoring.md):

- [ ] Extract duplication
- [ ] Deepen modules (move complexity behind simple interfaces)
- [ ] Apply SOLID principles where natural
- [ ] Consider what new code reveals about existing code
- [ ] Run tests after each refactor step

**Never refactor while RED.** Get to GREEN first.

## Checklist Per Cycle

```text
[ ] Test describes behavior, not implementation
[ ] Test uses public interface only
[ ] Test would survive internal refactor
[ ] Code is minimal for this test
[ ] No speculative features added
```

## Output

Report the acceptance-to-test map, the focused RED command and expected failure, the GREEN command and passing result,
refactor validation, remaining acceptance criteria, and any handoff blockers.

## Failure Rules

- Missing active ticket or acceptance criteria: stop before product code and route back to ticket/OpenSpec refinement.
- Missing acceptance-to-test map: stop before product code.
- Product code changed before a relevant failing test: stop, add the behavior test, confirm RED when still feasible,
then continue.
- Test couples to implementation details instead of public behavior: rewrite the test before using it as acceptance
coverage.
- Any acceptance criterion lacks committed automated coverage: stop before implementation handoff or PR review handoff.
- Validation cannot run: record the command gap and follow the owning delivery skill's failure policy before handoff.
